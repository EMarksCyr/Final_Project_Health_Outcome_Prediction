the machine learning needs to be predictive (so linear regression counts)
so you can just do linear regression


state hypotheses prior 

on thursday show mothanna:
 the database and the intial machine leaning model that I expect to use to predict the target variable and what kind of visualizations I plan on using (d3 or plotly within javascript or tableau) and make sure this is the data sert that I want 

provisional database in SQL to sjow the structure of how its going to look, can be mongodb or postgres. 

make sure the data set answer the questions I want to ask 
Maybe another dataset within this tpic is the best 
when you try to select a machine learning model use sas jump to use a visual interface to create different models and compare their performance given the data set 
after that 

essentially I need to make a provisional database with some sample data in mongodb or SQL to show what it's going to look like
pick my anticipated visualizations and comapre models with this data 


Downloaded sas jump

my analysis plan is to select factors likely to predict mental and physical health and perform linear regression to 
determine how much variance in subjective health can be predicted

What I have

I have the csv file with participant data and the legend to parse with question coding schemes 
I have the sql SQL data base up and running and ready for the data to be put in
I have the predictor screening on the uncleaned data 
A plan to use linear regression to determine which variables (alone or in combination) can best predict health outcomes
Will use Plotly (a visual interface like tableau is helpful to test out visualizations before writing out the code)
(the spider chart a good visualization for the performance)

polynomial regression when suspecting a non-linear relationship between predictors and outcomes
(look into this as an alternative) I suspect the relationship betwen activity freq/duration and subjective health would be logarithmic 
try both linear and polynomial and compare performance 

feature selection: the process of trying each model with different combo of features to return performance metrics, 
this would be more effective than a correlation matrix, maybe use both to isolate the best potential predictors for the regression model
stepwise, backqards selectiion vs forward selection (look into)

What I need 

The legend parsed and entered into the database
The data cleaned for SAS JMP to be effective

reach out to CDC to try to get 

take a look at canvas to see how many rows of data need to be incuded in the provisional database but i probably just need to fill it with 50 lines of fake data and write the code for a linear regression model that can take the data from the database

theres a case of:
 - a unique value
 - a value HIDDEN 
	- See interview date
 - no label 
	- But referes to a previous label, e.g. Interview Day
 - BLANK
 - Range (format is "# - #")
	- Label irrelevent, refer to previous label)
 	- First part of range unroll if repeated labels



when it comes to using a subset of the data bear in mind that the first 500 rows aren't representative of the whole set so don't draw any conclusions 

consider PCA considering how similar some features are, once you do this there a means for figuring out which features make up each component

pull state data and present heatmaps for diff features by location
also break down sample by demographics
pull demographic data to break down general health and diff diseases across SES, age, gender etc.
